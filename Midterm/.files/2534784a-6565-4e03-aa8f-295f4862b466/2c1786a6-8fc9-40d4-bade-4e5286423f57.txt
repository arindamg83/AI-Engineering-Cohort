tool where employees share their thoughts about making our company a better place to work. The anonymous third-party platform is designed to protect the
identity of the reporter and provide a mechanism for reporters to follow an investigation and receive responses.
We want NVIDIA to be a place where people can build their careers over their lifetime. Our employees tend to come and stay. In fiscal year 2024, our overall
turnover rate was 2.7%.
Compensation, Benefits, and Well-Being
Our compensation program rewards performance and is structured to encourage employees to invest in the Company’s future. Employees receive equity, except
where unavailable due to local regulations, that is tied to the value of our stock price and vests over time to retain employees while simultaneously aligning their
interests with those of our shareholders.
We offer comprehensive benefits to support our employees’ and their families’ physical health, well-being, and financial health. Programs include 401(k)
programs in the U.S., statutory and supplemental pension programs outside the U.S., our employee stock purchase program, flexible work hours, and time off
policies to address mental health, stress, and time-management challenges. We evaluate our benefit offerings globally and aim to provide comparable support
across the regions where we operate. We are committed to providing tailored benefits based on the needs of our Community Resource Groups and continuing
our support for parents, both new birth parents and those who wish to become parents.
