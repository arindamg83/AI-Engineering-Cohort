a full software stack. This has enabled us to architect data center-scale computing platforms that can interconnect thousands of compute nodes with high-
performance networking. While historically the server was the unit of computing, as AI and HPC workloads have become extremely large spanning thousands of
compute nodes, the data center has become the new unit of computing, with networking as an integral part.
Our end customers include the worldâ€™s leading public cloud and consumer internet companies, thousands of enterprises and startups, and public sector entities.
We work with industry leaders to help build or transform their applications and data center infrastructure. Our direct customers include original equipment
manufacturers, or OEMs, original device manufacturers, or ODMs, system integrators and distributors which we partner with to help bring our products to
market. We also have partnerships in automotive, healthcare, financial services, manufacturing, and retail among others, to accelerate the adoption of AI.
