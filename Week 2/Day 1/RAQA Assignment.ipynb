    "# What is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Definition of RAG:\n",
    "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) by retrieving and incorporating relevant context from a database of documents, which can include text and images, into their prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Purpose and Utility: \n",
    "RAG aims to provide up-to-date and specific context to LMMs that are \"frozen in time\" due to infrequent updates from their developers, which is caused by the high costs and resource demands of training. This technique allows for more tailored and accurate responses to queries by using fresh, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Challenges of Using LLMs Directly:\n",
    "Employing LLMs without RAG can lead to several issues:\n",
    "* Outdated Information: Since LLMs are trained on data up to a certain cutoff point, they may not have access to the latest developments or information, leading to outdated or inaccurate responses.\n",
    "* Generic Responses: LLMs often generate generalized answers that might not fit specific use cases or queries without the additional context that RAG provides.\n",
    "* Resource Intensity: Continuously retraining LLMs to stay current is resource-intensive, making it impractical for most applications, whereas RAG offers a more sustainable method to keep the model's outputs relevant."
